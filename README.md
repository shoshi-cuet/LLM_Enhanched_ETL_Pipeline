# Data Integration with LLM Enhanced ETL Pipeline

This repository contains the mechanisms and algorithm developed to present the Master thesis entitled **Enhancing Data Integration and Automation in Datalakes through Large Language Model(LLM)-Driven ETL Pipelines**. The thesis was completed as a requirement for the DATMAS course at the University of Stavanger in the spring semester of 2024.

The theme of the thesis was to find ways to integrate LLMs to enhance the poor conditions in the prevalent ETL data pipelines by automatic schema and complex metadata extraction.
